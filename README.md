Problem Statement:
The HR department of XYZ company is interested in analyzing the work patterns of their employees during the months of April, May, and June.
They want to observe trends in the number of working days, non-working days, work from home counts, and leave counts to gain insights into the
productivity and engagement levels of their workforce.
The HR team wants to utilize Power BI to create data visualizations and dashboards to showcase the trends and patterns in the employee data. 
The project aims to provide insights that can help the company make informed decisions regarding employee engagement, productivity, and resource allocation.

Learning Include:
* Gathering and Transforming Data Using Power Query:

Power Query is a feature in Power BI that helps to collect, transform and clean data from various sources such as Excel, CSV, databases, and more.
Power Query enables users to filter, sort, merge, and pivot data to make it ready for analysis.
The first step in using Power Query is to connect to the data source and import data into Power BI.
Power Query allows users to transform data by performing various operations such as changing data types, splitting columns, removing duplicates, and more.
Power Query also enables users to merge data from different sources and transform it into a single table.
Creating Metrics Using DAX:

* DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is a formula language used in Power BI to create calculated columns, measures, and calculated tables.
Calculated columns are created by using DAX formulas to derive values from existing columns in a table.
Measures are DAX formulas that aggregate data across multiple rows and tables.
To create the % of Work from Home metric, we can use the DAX formula: % Work from Home = (Sum of Work from Home Hours / Total Hours Worked) * 100.
To create the % of Sick Leave metric, we can use the DAX formula: % Sick Leave = (Sum of Sick Leave Hours / Total Hours Worked) * 100.
Creating a Usable Dashboard:

* A dashboard is a visual representation of data that provides insights into key performance indicators (KPIs).
A good dashboard should be easy to read, interactive, and visually appealing.
Power BI offers a variety of visualizations such as charts, tables, maps, and more to help create effective dashboards.
The first step in creating a dashboard is to select the appropriate visuals and arrange them in a logical order.
Power BI enables users to create interactive dashboards by using filters, slicers, and drill-down features.
